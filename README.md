# DEVELOPMENT LOG
### TIMOTHY STANSBERRY and NATHAN COOK

###### May 17th:
	-Timothy: Created the file, studied up on how to play tower defense.
	
	-Nathan: Studied up on how to play tower defense.
	
###### May 20th:
	-Timothy: Added classes and pictures, started on a few methods.
	
	-Nathan: Added classes and pictures with Timothy. We also discussed/debated on the exact use of all our classes and made a few changes.
	

###### May 21st:
	-Timothy: Worked on creating methods and played around with the implementation of all of our classes.
	-Nathan: Found pictures for our objects, worked with Timothy on creating methods.

###### May 22nd:
	-Timothy: Worked with force field class till realizing that it wasn't necessary, started on method that calculates the closest ship to a defense.
	-Nathan: Worked with visuals and essentially got our starting visuals working.

###### May 23rd:
	-Timothy: Wasn't in class because of an AP Exam, but Nathan and I went to the Dojo after school spent the time debugging the board generation, on his computer. Also finished findNearest. Worked on the relationship between defense and projectile at home.
	-Nathan: Worked on the display path in class, then went after school with Timothy to the Dojo where we worked on debugging the path. 

###### May 24th:
	-Timothy: Caught our Development Log up to date, while also continuing my work on defense/projectile from yesterday. Also helped Nathan debug his code. 
	-Nathan: Still trying to debug my path creation algorithm. 

###### May 27th:
	- Nathan: finished debugging the randomly generated path and it works.  Also made it so no squares of tiles appeared, making it more visually appealing and easier to see the path.
	-Timothy: Helped Nathan look over his code. Mostly worked on writing the move algorithm for the ships, which is now finished. It took a lot of sketching things out and talking them over with myself. 

###### May 28th: 
	-Nathan:
	-Timothy: Added a constructor for ships, which allowed us to test the move function. Fixed bugs in the move function, and added modifications so that the ships disappear and take damage away from the castle once they reach the end of the path.

###### May 29th:
	-Nathan:
	-Timothy: Worked on finding images for all the towers in class, and was unable to work at home due to a math test.

###### May 30th:
	-Nathan:
